* Page Caching stores full copies of pages on the disk so that php code and database queries can be skipped by the web server.
* Object Caching stores commonly used elements such as menus / widgets and forms on disk or in memory to speed up page rendering.
* Database cache stores copies of common database queries on disk or in memcory to speed up page rendering.

**Minify HTML Pages**:

* Auto Configure W3 Total Cache to remove excess white space and comments from html pages to compress their size.
* This provides for minor imporvements in page load time.

**Minify CSS Files**:
